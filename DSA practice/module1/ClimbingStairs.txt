Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps


// code

class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
       
        int steps =0;
        int s1 = 0;
        int s2 = 1;
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            steps = s1 + s2;
            s1 = s2;
            s2 = steps;
        }
        
        return steps;
    }
}
